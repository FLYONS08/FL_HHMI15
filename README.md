In order to elucidate the properties of an aged human hematopoietic system that may predispose to age-associated hematopoietic dysfunction, we evaluated HSC and other hematopoietic progenitor populations from healthy, hematologically normal young and elderly human bone marrow samples. We found that aged human HSC increase in frequency, are less quiescent, and exhibit myeloid-biased differentiation potential compared to young HSC.
